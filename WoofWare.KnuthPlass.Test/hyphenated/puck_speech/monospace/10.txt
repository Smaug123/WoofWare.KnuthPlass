If we
shadows
have of-
fended,
Think but
this, an-
d all is
mended,
That you
have but
slumber’d
here While
these vis-
ions did
appear.
And this
weak an-
d idle
theme,
No more
yield-
ing but
a dream,
Gentles,
do not
reprehend.
If you
pardon, we
will mend.
And, as I
am an hon-
est Puck,
If we have
unearnèd
luck Now
to ’s-
cape the
serpent’s
tongue, We
will make
amends ere
long; Else
the Puck a
liar call.
So, good
night unto
you all.
Give me y-
our hands,
if we be
friends,
And Robin
shall re-
store a-
mends.
