Mr. Ut-
terson the
lawyer was
a man of
a rugged
counten-
ance that
was never
lighted by
a smile;
cold,
scanty
and embar-
rassed in
discourse;
backward
in sen-
timent;
lean,
long,
dusty,
dreary and
yet some-
how lov-
able. At
friendly
meetings,
and when
the wine
was to
his taste,
something
eminently
human
beaconed
from his
eye; some-
thing in-
deed which
never
found its
way into
his talk,
but which
spoke not
only in
these si-
lent sym-
bols of
the af-
ter-dinner
face, but
more of-
ten and
loudly in
the acts
of his
life. He
was aus-
tere with
himself;
drank gin
when he
was alone,
to mor-
tify a
taste for
vintages;
and though
he en-
joyed the
theatre,
had not
crossed
the doors
of one
for twenty
years. But
he had an
approved
toler-
ance for
others;
sometimes
wonder-
ing, al-
most with
envy, at
the high
pressure
of spirits
involved
in their
misdeeds;
and in any
extremity
inclined
to help
rather
than to
reprove.
“I incline
to Cain’s
heresy,”
he used
to say
quaintly:
“I let my
brother
go to the
devil in
his own
way.” In
this char-
acter, it
was fre-
quently
his for-
tune to be
the last
reputable
acquaint-
ance and
the last
good in-
fluence
in the
lives of
downgoing
men. And
to such
as these,
so long as
they came
about his
chambers,
he never
marked a
shade of
change in
his de-
meanour.
